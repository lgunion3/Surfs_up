# Surf Shop Analysis 
## Overview
A surf and shake start up in Hawaii tasked me with analyzing the average weather in the locations of interest. The weather analysis was completed on the year. In addition to a year analysis, I examined the months of June and December. 
### Preprocessing
I imported the dependencies necessary to connect SQL to Python along with creating a flask route in Visual Studio for the client to view the precipitation and weather analysis results.
## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Conclusion
The weather in Oahu, Hawaii is ideal for a surf shop. Before breaking land an additional query I’d recommend would compare the temperature and amount of precipitation for the months of June and December. This may allow us to understand if there is a correlation and furthermore when peak season and slow season occur. The additional information may change the shop to seasonal operations. In addition, I’d complete the same analysis on the entire year to better hone in on each month's potential to be part of peak season.
